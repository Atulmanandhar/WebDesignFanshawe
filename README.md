#### Briefly explain how design principles such as proximity, contrast, typography, etc. are considered in your web design.

##### Contrast

Text and Background:
I decided to go with a minimalistic design palette consisting of a shade of black and white. When the background is of white color, I used black color as my text color, and vice-versa. Also for images and videos, I used white as my text color. There could be some parts of the image/video that are very bright and the white text wouldn't be visible in them. To combat this issue, I've placed a darker shade background color/linear gradient as a background.

Heading and Body Text:
I used different font sizes, weights, and a consistent font for headings, and sub-headings to distinguish from my regular content.

##### Repetition

Text and Background:
I used a consistent font family, sizes, and styles across the website.
h1,h2 - Atlas Sans
h3 - Sandman-fill
regular texts - Open sans

Color Palette:
I used a consistent color scheme with shades of black and white throughout the website.

##### Alignment

Text Alignment:
My text alignment is always centered (in some cases left-aligned, if it doesn't make sense) for a consistent appearance.

Content Blocks:
Similar groups of content are always styled and aligned similarly. An example can be seen in the cards of the home screen. The cards both have the same layout. Also, when I hover over the cards, they both have the same layout for texts.

##### Proximity

Form Fields: My input field and their respective label is close and consistent in the contact form.

Navigation Links: They are always next to each other, for quick navigation access.
Related content: Similar content such as a heading and it's description is always placed together.

#### Briefly explain what strategy or strategies were used to improve your website’s accessibility compliance.

1. alt tags: I added alt tags to images which will allow screen readers to convey visual content to users with visual impairments. This practice ensures that all users, including those who rely on screen readers, can understand the content conveyed by images.
2. tabIndex: I used the tabIndex attribute to ensure keyboard navigation is smooth and logical. By setting a proper tab order, users can navigate through interactive elements and form fields seamlessly using the keyboard.
3. aria-label and aria-labelledby: I used these ARIA attributes to provide alternative and descriptive labels for elements. They assist screen reader users in understanding the purpose and context of elements like headings and links.

Additionally, I implemented the scroll-snap CSS feature, enabling keyboard navigation across entire section elements throughout the webpage. This inclusive approach aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for all visitors, particularly those with disabilities.

#### Briefly explain what search engine optimization strategy or strategies were used in your website.

In my website, I used effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to enhance its visibility and relevance.

For the home page, I used targeted meta tags, including descriptive description and keywords attributes, to convey the essence of Nepal's beauty and architecture gems. Similarly, for the contact page, I optimized the meta tags with relevant longtail keywords and content descriptions to allow users in learning more about Nepal's attributes and contacting us through the contact form. These strategic meta tag implementations aim to improve search engine rankings and attract organic traffic by aligning the website's content with users' search intent.
